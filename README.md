# Example Python Django with external OIDC Provider for a Wep application

This repository provides a Django example for ZITADEL using OpenID connect (OIDC) authentication instead of the internal authentication mechanism.
This example is provided as companion to our [guide](https://zitadel.com/docs/examples/login/python-django),
which should produce this application when followed.

## Base

The used base is the "Writing your first Django app" from the Django documentation under [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/), which has documented additional parts in to use [mozilla-django-oidc](https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-django-oidc) to integrate ZITADEL as AuthenticationBackend.

## Features

- OIDC Code flow with User Info call after authentication.
- Fully integrated with Django authentication
- User Role mapping to standard user types in Django (superuser/staff/user)
- Persistent user data using local sqlite file. See `DATABASE_URL` in [.env](.env).
- Public page at `/polls`
- Authenticated `/polls/<id>/` page for all users.
- Authenticated `/polls/<id>/results/` page for staff role users.
- Authenticated `/admin/` pages for admin role users.

## Getting started

If you want to run this example directly you can fork and clone it to your system.
Be sure to [configure ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/docs/examples/login/django#zitadel-setup) to accept requests from this app.

### Prerequisites

You have to install Python as described in [their documentation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) and then download all dependencies through:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively if you have a system with Docker and an IDE capable of running [Development Container](https://containers.dev/),
definitions are provided with a complete Python environment, configuration and tools required for Django development.
Use your IDE to build and launch the development environment or use GitHub code spaces from your browser.

### Django

After setting up your system and repository, create the sqlite-database.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Fill in the `.env`-file in your directory with the following information:

```bash
ZITADEL_PROJECT = "ID of the project you created the application in ZITADEL" 
OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID = "ClientID provided by the created application in ZITADEL"
OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET = "ClientSecret provided by the created application in ZITADEL"
OIDC_OP_BASE_URL = "Base URL for your ZITADEL instance"
```

I should look something like this:

```bash
ZITADEL_PROJECT = "249703732336418456" 
OIDC_RP_CLIENT_ID = "249703852243222580@python"
OIDC_RP_CLIENT_SECRET = "Zy3OOHaMBTj2sfamW87Vak5BeQ3nEpOf7suPKTnJKaScMh0lPJqUeDOZmgL3bdGa"
OIDC_OP_BASE_URL = "https://example.zitadel.cloud"
```

And run the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), where you see all available endpoints.

You can create Questions and the availabe Choices, where users can vote on.
After you can go to [http://localhost:8000/polls/](http://localhost:8000/polls/) and vote on different Questions.
